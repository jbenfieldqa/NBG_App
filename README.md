# NBG_App

This project is to create two components that will interact with each other as part of an enterprise level system. The components will interact with each other as well as the Order Placement Application (OPA) developed in Java Foundations. The first component is the Online Catalogue which will serve as NB Gardens customer facing online store. This component will have a web based front end which will allow users to browse the full product range, register as customers, place and track orders. Once users have placed an order this should be saved to a database for the warehouse to access. When an order has been placed the database used by the IMS should be updated to reflect the fact that stock has been allocated to an order. The second component is the Inventory Management System (IMS) which is responsible for managing the stock levels of products. This will involve calculating and predicting product demands and generating purchase orders for stock items. The IMS is also used for adding new products and discontinuing products by the Inventory Manager.
