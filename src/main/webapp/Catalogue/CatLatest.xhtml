					<p> For years many of us have wondered what the best way of showing our appreciation of our gnomic friends. They watch over our gardens and protect our ponds, yet we can do nothing to show our love and appreciation. But a recent creative movement is rapidly changing that.</p>
					<p>Recently, we here at NBGardens have come across an increasing number of poems paying homage to gardens gnomes. They range from long epics to short haikus. Some of them rhyme, whilst overs don't. The only things these poems have in common is their inspiration. And the writers have chosen that inspiration well.  </p>
